hi yea I made a cool thing download it

This uses the ROBLOX api to get information about a player, including display name and status (both invisible on the ROBLOX website for most of the world.) This was created in python so if you don't have python that's not my problem

if you do have python however, install the requests and json module.

In update 0.2, it logs your serches into a file called "history.txt" so if you want to go back to it you can.
It is also self updating, if you have 0.2 and 0.3 is out, it will auto install 0.3. Look for the file with the version number.
