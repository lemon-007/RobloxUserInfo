hi yea I made a cool thing download it

This uses the ROBLOX api to get information about a player, including display name and status (both invisible on the ROBLOX website for most of the world.) This was created in python so if you don't have python that's not my problem

if you do have python however, install the requests and json module.

sorry for making a zip file its the only way I could get all the stuff to fit.
